# Automation and Scripting

## Course Overview

In today's world, the development of information systems requires complex projects that involve numerous technological steps: building, testing, deployment, and monitoring. Automating these processes has become an integral part of modern software, allowing teams to deliver quality products faster and more efficiently. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of automation and scripting. It also presents the automation tool Jenkins, detailing its deployment and usage. Prior to this course, students should have completed the courses: `Operating Systems`, `Networking Technologies`, `Python Programming`, and `Virtualization and Containerization`.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the concepts of automation and its benefits.
- Write scripts to automate tasks using various programming languages.
- Use tools and frameworks for automation.
- Configure and use Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
- Optimize and scale automation solutions.
- Understand and apply best practices for security in automation.
